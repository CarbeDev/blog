# Quick presentation

I asked my girlfriend, how would you describe me, here's what she said :
"Kevin, 24, wrestling and vanilla milk's fan", I don't know if it's the best or the worst desciption of myself.
Even my love can have some troubles to describing me. I'm such a complex person.  

## A Wrestling fan
Yeah she's right, i'm a big wrestling fan. 
I know, when I will be old, I won't miss any episode just like my father is doing with "The Young and the Restless".

The combination between fight and theater is exciting. I could watch a soccer game where there are no shots, just a succession of passes, the definition of a boring game.
This is not possible in wrestling.
Not every show is good, but the business needs to give good stories, build great characters, and deliver outstanding matches to keep the audience watching.  
Last May, I realized one of my childhood dreams, going to a WWE show. Not just any, but the legendary Backlash France. The first televised show in my own country.
This is the most memorable night of my life. Just look at my smile when Cody Rhodes, the superstar of the company, saw the fire through my eyes,
took my phone and took my most valuable photo in my gallery.

## A Football player
I'm a bit disappointed that my girlfriend didn't speak about my die-hard passion : American football
I am currently playing for the Paris Dragons, a French D2 team, as a running back.
Despite the injuries, the heartbreaking buzzer beater losses and night training in negative temperatures, this sport and all the coaches that i had,
taught me discipline, team spirit, leadership and so much other things. If I am the man that I am today, it's because of it.

That's why I'm also a coach for young football and flag players.
All these values are essantial for a kid to have all the keys to succeed in studies and as a good human, whatever you want to do later.
 
Speaking of my first two passions was important for me. Most of my personality is built by them.
Now that you have a first vision of me, I think we can continue to the main part : the tech !  

# Just a chill tech guy

## The origin story
I remember the first time I touched a keyboard, I was 5.
It was for playing educational game for children (One day, I'll buy PyjamaSam to finish it for real).
But I had to wait until 9 to have an internet connection.
Living that long without connection gave me the chance to be thankful for having any info instantly.
I lost quite a long time watching tutorials on my favorites video games (more adult this time, but I was so bad).
It's only at 16, during my first high school year, that I started programming.

## From Game to code
I wanted to be a video game developer (but DAMN, it's hard, shoutout to all video games developers, you way too strong).
I started with basics, HTML, CSS and then went to industrial programming with Arduino (C++) and finally more complex apps with Java or PHP.  

## Where I am now ?
8 years after my first line of code, I'm a backend developer (I can do frontend, but I don't like that) specialized on JVM languages, more specifically Kotlin. I can do mobile too, with Kotlin or Flutter.
In other words, I can program in most of languages, maybe not efficiently but I can produce something (still a JS hater anyways).

## The Hyped developer life
I identify myself as a HDD (not Hard Disk Drive but Hyped Driven Developer).
Every day, I'm reading articles, watching videos or lives, trying new technologies. It comes with minuses and pluses.  
Of course, it's cool to see a project that's you see potential befroe everyone being trendy.
For example, I discovered cursor weeks before a lot of people on my Youtube or Twitter feeds.
And now it's the IDE most of indie hackers use to ship fast.  
I always have tools for everything, you need to write a pipeline with code, use [Dagger](https://dagger.io/),
You need to add E2E tests on your mobile app, write them with [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/)

*<center>Realising I'm spoiling my next articles</center>*  
You may know this if you are a devops or a mobile developer, but a lot of people don't.

### The dark side
It can be a bad flaw too. I never finish any project because i always discover something new (shiny object syndromie), 
you'll be shocked if I show you my project cemetery.  

## Why this blog
That's why I decided to write my own articles. I will have to finish project to show the in the [project](/project) section, 
And if I can share with you all golden nuggets of tomorrow, it will kill two birds with one stone (this expression is so dramatic in english). 
I will also speak about my life because it can inspire some people and it's always good for the mental health to write down what you think.
