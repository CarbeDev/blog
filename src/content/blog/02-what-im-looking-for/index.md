There are so many things that can happen in two years. For example, I went from being a medical assistant in 2020 to being a work-study developer in 2022.  
For my first article on my brand new blog, I gonna recap my last two years and give a projection for the two next. Maybe, if I'm still alive in two years, I will write a new one to see the difference between what you'll read below and what really happened.

# Two years at Octo

It's been two years since I joined Octo Technology in October 2022.

-- insert a photo of me at Octo --  

Octo is a software service firm based in Paris that was acquired by Accenture in 2016. They specialize in software developement best practices, and that's why their consultants cost twice the market price.    
In a way, I can understand why. Having poor legacy code can quickly become a real pain for the team (if you know, you know). But when you try to sell a work-study consultant for 400â‚¬ ADR (Average Daily Rate), don't be surprised if nobody wants them. Anyway...  
One of the mottos of the company is "Great place to grow" and I quite agree with that.
Being an Octo, it's not just being an employee in a company, it's being part of an adventure among passionate people.
Octo gives their developers time, outside of their mission, to go to conferences, write articles, or just gather around subject they love speaking about.  
But as a level 1 consultant, I have "just" one day per month where I can use my work time to dig into a topic. In comparison, a level 2 can use three days.
Of course, I'm using my free time to discover some technologies or dig deeper into the ones that I already know, but when a L2 can be paid for that and the company announces that there will be no level increases for the next two years, it makes me mad.  
Octo is a great place to grow, but I need more, I need **MY** best place to grow. I have to see what the market can offer and find it.

# So what's next ?
I will not quit Octo for a company that is not as good as Octo (even with a higher salary). This company has set the bar pretty high, and I think it will be difficult to find a better one.    
So, what I will watch for my next position ?

## The Responsabilities
In my mentality, all voices need to be heard. It has to be the same where I'm working. Maybe I'm still a junior (depending on the team level) but I have an opinion about a lot of things thanks to all the articles that I read and videos that I watch.

## The product
I love being able to challenge a request. not just technically but with a product vision. Asking what the Product team wants, why they want it, thinking about whether there is better way to do it.
And it's not possible if you don't like the product you're working on. If you read my [first article](/blog/01-who-am-i), you know that I love use new tools,
you know that I am a visionary, I am revolutionary, I am ...

Maybe the best place is a startup ? Using the latest technologies to build a product that can really help, or just a product about my passions: sport and video games. I don't know, but I will not go somewhere if I not conviced by the product.

## Location
I need something new ! I have lived in Paris my whole life, and I love this city (we've just made the best Olympic Games ever). But in the last two years, I have had the opportunity to travel and discover the world.
France (outside of Paris, it's another country),Spain, UK, Japan, but there is one destination where i felt like home: Sweden.

I went to Sweden in March 2024, on a solo trip. That was literally the best two weeks of my life.  
I stayed three days in Stockholm and a week at Abisko, in the very north of Scandinavia.
I love cold weather so i felt like a fish in water with the negative temperature. The people was so nice, they integrate me with the nordic culture (I love the sauna at the end of the day). And I more agree with the political decisions taken than with the french ones.  
I'm also open to other countries. Why not live the american dream under the sun of Cali, cohabit with spiders in Aussie desert or learn strange expressions in the land where maple syrup flows (Tabarnak!) 
# Conclusion
I'm ready for a complete life change. Whether it leads me to Sweden or elsewhere, the time has come to embrace new challenges and pursue growth, not just as a professional, but as a person.
