OCTO Technology is a cool tech consulting company born in Paris back in 1998.
They're basically a bunch of passionate tech experts who help companies transform their digital game - whether it's building awesome software, coaching teams, or reimagining how organizations work.  
At Octo, you're not just another tech consultant, you're part of a community that's serious about leveling up your game.
The company is big on software craftsmanship, where you'll learn to write clean, solid code through practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD).  
What's really cool is how they mix technical excellence with business smarts.
You're not just coding, you're understanding the 'why' behind what you build.
You're constantly surrounded by experts who love sharing their knowledge, whether it's through pair programming, internal tech talks, or casual coffee chats.
And if you're worried about keeping up with tech trends, don't be. Staying on top of the latest innovations is literally part of the job
