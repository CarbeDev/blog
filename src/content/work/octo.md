At OCTO Technology, I had the chance to be part of a vibrant tech community rather than just another consulting firm.
Born in Paris in 1998, OCTO brings together passionate tech experts who help companies
transform their digital landscape, whether itâ€™s by building great software,
coaching teams, or rethinking how organizations work.  

What really stood out to me was the strong culture of technical excellence and knowledge sharing.
I learned how to write clean, maintainable code through practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and software craftsmanship.
But more importantly, I learned to think beyond the code, to understand the why behind what we build and how it brings real value to the business.  

At OCTO, you're constantly surrounded by experts 
who genuinely enjoy sharing what they know through pair programming, internal tech talks, or just casual coffee chats.
And since staying on top of tech trends is part of the job,
I always had opportunities to explore new technologies, experiment,
and grow my skills in a meaningful way.
