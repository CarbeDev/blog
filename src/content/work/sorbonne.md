I worked as a support technician at Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris 3),
a prestigious French university known for its focus on humanities, languages, arts, and media studies.  

In that role, I handled a wide range of technical issues,
from setting up workstations to troubleshooting software and network problems. 
It was a hands-on environment that demanded patience, adaptability,
and a methodical approach to solving problems, skills that are essential in development too.  

My time there also gave me my first real exposure to Linux and server environments.
At first, it was a steep learning curve,
but that early contact with system administration built a solid foundation
that continues to help me today.  

Support work taught me how to break down complex issues,
communicate clearly with non-technical users, and stay calm under pressure.
Itâ€™s that same problem-solving mindset I now bring into every project as a developer.
