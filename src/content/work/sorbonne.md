Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris 3) is a prestigious French university specializing in humanities, languages, arts, and media studies.  
Having a background as a support technician brings invaluable advantages to a developer's journey.
While you might have had a challenging experience learning Linux during your studies, that initial exposure laid an essential foundation for understanding operating systems and server environments.  
Support work develops crucial troubleshooting skills, you learn to approach problems systematically, break them down into manageable pieces, and persist until finding a solution.
This methodical problem-solving mindset is exactly what makes a great developer.
