It's been a while that i'm thinking about launching a blog. But i was reticent because of my 'lack' of experience. Am i legit ?
Who would read a blog by a junior developer that barely speaks english and has so much bad taste on frontend ?
But then, I write down my goals for 2025. The first is "Become a better developper".  
One of the best way to do it is by explain what you learn to someone else. Why not share these explanations to the world ?
In the first hand, someone will learn a thing in one of the articles, and in the other other, I can be correct by someone if I said something wrong.

I'm using the astro sphere template from (markhorn-dev)[https://github.com/markhorn-dev], I will update the ui if neededÂ§
