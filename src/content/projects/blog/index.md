It has been a while since I've been thinking about launching a blog. But I was reluctant because of my 'lack' of experience. Am I legitimate?
Who would read a blog by a junior developer that barely speaks English and has such bad taste in frontend?
But then, I wrote down my goals for 2025. The first is "Become a better developer".
One of the best ways to do it is by explaining what you learn to someone else. Why not share these explanations with the world?
On one hand, someone will learn something from one of the articles, and on the other hand, I can be corrected by someone if I say something wrong.  
I'm using the astro sphere template from (markhorn-dev)[https://github.com/markhorn-dev].
