It's been a while that i'm thinking about launching a blog. But i was reticent because of my 'lack' of experience. Am i legit ?
Who would read a blog by a junior developer that barely speaks english and has so much bad taste on frontend ?
But then, I write down my goals for 2025. The first is "Become a better developper".
